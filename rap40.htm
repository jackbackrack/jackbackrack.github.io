(set to mandiani) <BR>
<BR>
<i>
His name is JB, His name is JB, <BR>
one to the two to the two to the three, <BR>
His name is JB, magnificently <BR>
he pounds out mandiani beats at the DC <BR>
born but not raised in the state of NC, <BR>
Grown but still young like infancy, <BR>
Look around and you will see <BR>
that big baybee is half crazee, <BR>
No not crazy I'd say genius is better, <BR>
At MIT is where he makes his cheddar, <BR>
In varsity tennis that boy earned his letter, <BR>
wearing orange sweaters, the constant go-getter, <BR>
His name is JB, or Jack Bach-a-Rach, <BR>
Seven days a week he's on the attack, <BR>
Locking his bicycle on the bike rack, <BR>
When he gets down, I put down the smack: <BR>
"Listen, JB, don't be such a fool, <BR>
"At the Deli Haus, it's all cool, <BR>
"And you know the Golden Rule: <BR>
"Dance and Drum -- the ladies will drool." <BR>
A dancing star, he loves Sabar, <BR>
Two months ago, punks stole his car, <BR>
Yet he flies all around and he makes it look effortless, <BR>
Nobody knows how much work he puts into this, <BR>
But I do -- I see that shit every day, <BR>
Some say we hang out so much that we're gay. <BR>
No comment on that, except to say this: <BR>
For his birthday present I gave him a kiss, <BR>
A nice juicy fat one right on the lips? <BR>
No, a bottle of liquor for him to take sips. <BR>
His name is JB, with long curly locks, <BR>
Poppin up everywhere, Jack-in-the-Box, <BR>
A master of rhythm for djun djun to algo- <BR>
His parents are here from way out in New Mexico, <BR>
So get your butts out to dance, drink your beer, <BR>
JB's been on this planet for forty years! <BR>
</I>
<BR>
(slow it down, old school) <BR>
<BR>
<I>
Now here's a little story that must be heard <BR>
about a 40-year-old computer nerd, <BR>
He's got a cool life, but I got to mock it, <BR>
Got an apartment 'bout as big as my pocket, <BR>
Got a photo of John Immel stored in a locket, <BR>
Shot a jumper over Balla, but Balla blocked it. <BR>
Showed up at MIT with some charts and graphs <BR>
and Ideas for a spaceship, Professors laughed. <BR>
He said, "All we need to add is a level of indirection." <BR>
He looked all disheveled with a high voice inflection. <BR>
His boss said, "JB, don't start an insurrection, <BR>
"Go sit yourself back down in the drum section." <BR>
So he rode on his bike like a witch across the moon, <BR>
Arm wrestled Joh for dibs on the djun djun, <BR>
Then stretched his neck out so he could get loose, <BR>
This happens every Tuesday night at Astou's, <BR>
He dances on Wednesday nights at Seydous <BR>
After learning the djembe from the one we call Moose. <BR>
Stays on his game like uh-ev-er-y day, <BR>
Ruler of Cambridge, US and UK, <BR>
Roots for the Red Sox but they are cursed, <BR>
Sports more colors than a pack a Starburst, <BR>
Running mach speed in the mental, <BR>
So suave they call'em Artificially Intelli-gentle, <BR>
But more than that they just call him a dork, <BR>
Lou and Santa Fe got this kid from a stork, <BR>
Somebody find a Mindy 'cause we got us a Mork <BR>
who loves chick music, Portishead and Bjork, <BR>
It's just silly JB, clever on the scene, <BR>
Performing in the Joh Show November Seventeenth, <BR>
Show some respect if you know what I mean, <BR>
This Weenie's turning 40, not fourteen. <BR>
