<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Jonathan Bachrach is an anatomically 
  modern human with physical agility, acute senses, teeth that can cut as well 
  as chew, and a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence. His bipedal gait is admittedly 
  ungainly; in terms of the energy required to move proportional units of body 
  mass over given distances, Dr. Bachrach is only slightly more efficient than 
  a penguin. However, his locomotive adaptation provides other benefits that more 
  than justify the bold evolutionary move. Primarily, it opens up rich new food 
  supply niches that his four-legged cousins are unable to exploit. In short, 
  Dr. Bachrach's upright stance frees him for a nomadic existence. While he can 
  also flourish in place as long as resources remain abundant, when environmental 
  circumstances change he is easily able to adapt--even to innovate. </i></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jonathan Bachrach's forthright 
  bipedalism keys his success in other ways as well. Significantly, it results 
  in a lower percentage of his body being exposed to the direct rays of the sun. 
  In itself, this adaptation improves his ability to forage; combined with the 
  naked skin that marks his highly efficient cooling system, Dr. Bachrach is able 
  to withstand conditions on the open savanna that would leave other mammals hunched 
  over and gasping in short order. In a world where sufficient hydration spells 
  the difference between life and death, Dr. Bachrach's strategy truly gives him 
  a leg up on the competition. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Bachrach has also been able 
  to use his free hands to make tools. Indeed, anthropologists often consider 
  this ability to be his foremost characteristic, calling him "Bachrach the Toolmaker." 
  Taken together, his stance, his hands, and his cooling system have created the 
  necessary conditions for the development of Dr. Bachrach's large cranial capacity, 
  which currently stands at a robust 1,900 cubic centimeters. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is difficult to overestimate 
  the importance of brain size to Dr. Bachrach's achievements. He has learned 
  to eat nutritious foods that eliminate the necessity of a large belly. He has 
  formed elaborate social networks and accompanying behavioral characteristics 
  that enrich as well as enable his survival. Most importantly of all, while he 
  retains an atavistic flair for grooming, he relies mainly on language to cement 
  social bonds, cooperate with others, and generate increasingly sophisticated 
  ideas about the physical and spiritual world. It is his special preoccupation 
  with language that has led Dr. Bachrach to work on Dylan, representing perhaps 
  humanity's highest and most powerful achievement in the field to date. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Bachrach attributes his overall 
  success to three fundamental preconditions: eccentricity, tilt, and the precession 
  of the equinoxes. What he is most proud of, however, is the length of his "plumbing": 
  Laid end to end, his blood vessels, lymph and urinary tracts would encircle 
  the globe--twice! </font></i></p>
